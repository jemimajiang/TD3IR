# TD3
This is a concise Pytorch implementation of TD3(Twin Delayed DDPG) on continuous action space.<br />


## How to use my code?
You can dircetly run 'TD3.py' in your own IDE.<br />

### Trainning and evaluating
```
python TD3.py
```

### How to see the training results?
You can use the tensorboard to visualize the training curves, which are saved in the file 'runs'.<br />
The rewards data are saved as numpy in the file 'data_train'.<br />
